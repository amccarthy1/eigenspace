Eigenspace
==========

A twitch bot built using [`xtb`](https://github.com/amccarthy1/xtb).

## Usage
 - `npm install`
 - create `auth.json` (see `auth.json.example` for an example)
 - `npm start`

## What is this?
Eigenspace is the name of a chat bot I wrote using my eXtensible Twitch Bot library, xtb.
It serves as my own twitch bot and a more realistic example of how to use xtb and its
various plugins. (It also motivates the design and development of the xtb ecosystem).

## Can I Contribute?
Sure! If you find a bug or improvement, or maybe you just want to boost your resume,
feel free to submit a pull request and I'll review it as soon as I can! Here are the
rules for contributing:
 - Make sure your code passes the linter and tests by running `npm test`.
 - If you're fixing a bug with a plugin, then you should open the PR against that repository.
 - If your change is a large-scale change, you might want to check with me first or open an
   issue to make sure we're on the same page.

This code is licensed under the MIT license, so you are free to make a fork to write your
own bot if you want. Just make sure you follow the rules of the license and give credit where necessary :)
